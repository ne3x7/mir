## Musical instrument recognition using scikit-learn and essentia

The idea of the project is to make a working classifier for musical compositions. The purpose was achieved with the help of different ensemble machine learning algorithms and a number of feature-generating methods from Essentia library.

I was able to achieve up to 80% quality on three classes. However, the answers of the algorithm seem off-balance, so further work is needed.

The paper and a presentation are attached as pdf.
